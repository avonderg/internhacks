## Where Organization and Mindfulness Meet.
Prioritize is a mobile app that helps users organize their lives and promote productivity and self care. The app will ask users to input their day-by-day events such as meetings and classes, as well as tasks and assignments they have to accomplish. The app would determine the free time that the user has based on the events they have scheduled, then block out time to work on each task. It would also determine the remaining free time the user will have and designate lunch periods, screen breaks, or time to do something they enjoy such as spending time with family and friends, reading a book, or playing their favorite sport, all to avoid burnout and feel more relaxed. 

## Problem Statement
It is no surprise that both high school and college students are stressed. Whether it be due to the day-to-day stressors of school and class, navigating friendships, or even just discovering where they fit in the world, itâ€™s easy to quickly become overwhelmed. For this reason, many of these students find themselves having a very difficult time managing their assignments and extracurricular activities, while having to make time for themselves to wind down and relax. Mental health is an extremely important topic amongst high school and college students, with research indicating that 1 in 5 teens between the ages of 12 and 18 suffer from at least one mental health disorder. We think it is important for us to provide them with a simple, discreet, and accessible tool that will help them navigate through these day-to-day stressors, feel overall more organized with their lives, and in turn become practitioners of healthy habits of mental wellbeing.
